         "Armed forces occupations include all jobs held by members of the armed forces.  Members of the armed forces are those personnel who are currently serving in the armed forces, including auxiliary services, whether on a voluntary or compulsory basis, and who are not free to accept civilian employment and are subject to military discipline. Included are regular members of the army, navy, air force and other military services, as well as conscripts enrolled for military training or other service for a specified period.\nOccupations in this major group are classified into the following sub-major groups:\n01  Commissioned Armed Forces Officers\n02  Non-commissioned Armed Forces Officers\n03  Armed Forces Occupations, Other Ranks\nExcluded from this group are: \n -  jobs held by persons in civilian employment of government establishments concerned with defence issues;\n -  police (other than military police);\n -  customs inspectors and members of border or other armed civilian services.\nNotes\nMany jobs performed by members of the armed forces are similar, in terms of the nature of the work performed, to civilian occupations such as medical doctors, radio operators, cooks, secretaries and heavy truck drivers.  Conceptually, it may be appropriate, therefore, to classify such jobs in the armed forces with similar civilian jobs.  This approach is adopted in several national occupation classifications.  Typically such classifications also identify a number of military-specific occupational groups.  In many countries, however, it is not possible to produce information about the nature of the work performed by members of the armed forces.  In adapting ISCO-08 for national purposes countries may wish, therefore, to consider what approach best suits their circumstances and user needs.  For purposes of international comparability, however, where data pertaining to members of the armed forces are reported and classified by occupation, they should be included, where possible, in ISCO-08 Major Group 0: Armed Forces Occupations.\n"

Competent performance in most occupations in this major group requires skills at the fourth ISCO skill level, except for Sub-major Group 14: Hospitality, Retail and Other Services Managers, for which skills at the third ISCO skill level are generally required. \nTasks performed by managers usually include: formulating and advising on the policy, budgets, laws and regulations of enterprises, governments and other organizational units; establishing objectives and standards and formulating and evaluating programmes and policies and procedures for their implementation; ensuring appropriate systems and procedures are developed and implemented to provide budgetary control; authorizing material, human and financial resources to implement policies and programmes; monitoring and evaluating performance of the organization or enterprise and of its staff; selecting or approving the selection of  staff;  ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements; planning and directing daily operations; representing and negotiating on behalf of the government, enterprise or organizational unit managed in meetings and other forums.\nOccupations in this major group are classified into the following sub-major groups:\n11 Chief Executives, Senior Officials and Legislators\n12 Administrative and Commercial Managers\n13 Production and Specialized Services Managers\n14 Hospitality, Retail and Other Services Managers\nNotes\nIn distinguishing between managers classified in Major Group 1: Managers, and supervisors, classified in other major groups, it should be noted that both managers and supervisors may plan, organize, coordinate, control and direct the work done by others.  In addition, managers usually have responsibility for and make decisions about: the overall strategic and operational direction of a business or organizational unit (for example about the kinds, quantity and quality of goods to be produced); budgets (how much money is to be spent and for what purposes); and the selection, appointment and dismissal of staff.  Supervisors may provide advice and assistance to managers on these matters, especially in relation to staff selection and dismissal, but do not have authority to make decisions.\nIt should be noted that it is not a necessary condition that managers have responsibility for all three of strategic and operational direction, budgets and staff selection and dismissal. The degree of autonomy they exercise may also vary. The critical difference is that supervisors are responsible only for the supervision of the activities of other workers, whereas managers have overall responsibility for the operations of an organizational unit.\n"
